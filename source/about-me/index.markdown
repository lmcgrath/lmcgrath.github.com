## About Me

Hi, I'm Logan McGrath, and I'm a software engineer.

Most of my free time is spent doing full time language development. Mostly for
learning, but mostly because I also have the crazy dream of eventually having
something out in the wild. I write about my learnings in the hope that language
development can be more accessible to the masses. Everyone should be able to
contribute to help make our most core tools more usable and friendly.

I've also picked up Minecraft modding to pull myself out of the deep pit of
language development from time to time. The community documentation around
modding is very anemic, and I hope to write more about this as I learn for the
benefit of other aspiring modders. I should also add I'm deeply addicted to
minecraft.

More information about me can be found on my [LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/loganmcgrath).
