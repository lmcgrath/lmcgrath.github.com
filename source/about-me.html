Hi, I'm Logan McGrath, and I'm a software engineer. Most of my free time is
spent doing full time language development. Mostly for learning, but mostly
because I also have the crazy dream of eventually having something out in the
wild.

I've also picked up Minecraft modding to keep myself out of the pit of
language development. The community documentation around this area is very
anemic, and I hope to write more about this as I learn for the benefit of other
aspiring modders.

More information about me can be found on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/logan-mcgrath/36/610/a40).
