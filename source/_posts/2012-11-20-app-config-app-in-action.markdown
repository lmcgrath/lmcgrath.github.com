Paul Hammant found this cool [Server-Side Piano](https://github.com/lmcgrath/angular-java-server-midi) and I've modified it to be configurable from a running App-Config-App. Because the sound is generated at the server, you're able to see (hear) the Server-Side Piano change its configuration without reloading the UI.</p>

## Making it work for yourself

I've updated the [App-Config-App](https://github.com/lmcgrath/app-config-app) with additional configuration to support choosing which instrument the Server-Side Piano will play. A clean install of App-Config-App using `setup_examples.rb` will provide everything needed to run the Server-Side Piano.

The application's configuration URL and credentials are located in `web.xml`. Additional details may be found in the application's [README](https://github.com/lmcgrath/angular-java-server-midi/blob/master/README.markdown).
