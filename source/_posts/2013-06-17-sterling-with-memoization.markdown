In my [last post](/blog/2013/06/16/sterling-benchmarks/) I wrote about performance in the
[Sterling](https://github.com/lmcgrath/sterling) programming language with a basic benchmark. Today I'm ticking off one
**@TODO** item: memoization.

Sterling now stores the results of each function/argument pair, returning respective results rather than forcing a
recalculation of an already-known value. I've leveraged the benchmark from the previous post, and the difference in
execution speed is very pronounced:

``` bash The Results
Java Benchmark
--------------
Iteration 0: executions = 100; elapsed = 6 milliseconds
Iteration 1: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 2: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 3: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 4: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 5: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 6: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 7: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 8: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
Iteration 9: executions = 100; elapsed = 4 milliseconds
--------------
Average for 10 iterations X 100 executions: 4 milliseconds

Sterling Benchmark
------------------
Iteration 0: executions = 100; elapsed = 648 milliseconds
Iteration 1: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 2: executions = 100; elapsed = 1 milliseconds
Iteration 3: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 4: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 5: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 6: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 7: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 8: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 9: executions = 100; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
------------------
Average for 10 iterations X 100 executions: 64 milliseconds
```

Sterling without memoization required on average 0.079 seconds to calculate the 20th member of the Fibonacci sequence,
but with memoization, the amount of time shrinks to 0.006 seconds. The time penalty only applies the first time the
function is executed for a given argument, so call times become near-instantaneous.

## Sterling is faster than Java!

Not really. But it is if I fiddle with the benchmark variables a bit (:

By changing the benchmark to execute the Fibonacci function 1000 times for 100 iterations, something interesting
happens:

``` bash Fiddling with the benchmark
Java Benchmark
--------------
Iteration 0: executions = 1000; elapsed = 42 milliseconds
Iteration 1: executions = 1000; elapsed = 39 milliseconds
Iteration 2: executions = 1000; elapsed = 38 milliseconds
Iteration 3: executions = 1000; elapsed = 39 milliseconds
Iteration 4: executions = 1000; elapsed = 39 milliseconds
Iteration 5: executions = 1000; elapsed = 39 milliseconds
Iteration 6: executions = 1000; elapsed = 41 milliseconds
Iteration 7: executions = 1000; elapsed = 40 milliseconds
Iteration 8: executions = 1000; elapsed = 38 milliseconds
Iteration 9: executions = 1000; elapsed = 38 milliseconds
...
Iteration 99: executions = 1000; elapsed = 39 milliseconds
--------------
Average for 100 iterations X 1000 executions: 39 milliseconds

Sterling Benchmark
------------------
Iteration 0: executions = 1000; elapsed = 629 milliseconds
Iteration 1: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 2: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 3: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 4: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 5: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 6: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 7: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
Iteration 8: executions = 1000; elapsed = 1 milliseconds
Iteration 9: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
...
Iteration 99: executions = 1000; elapsed = 0 milliseconds
------------------
Average for 100 iterations X 1000 executions: 6 milliseconds
```

### This benchmark smells funny

Yes, the performance in this benchmark is very contrived. But this does present an interesting property of applications
written in Sterling: If an application performs a great deal of repeated calculations, it will run faster over time. A
quick glance at the second bench mark will show that Java is performing the calculation every single time it is called,
whereas Sterling only requires the first call and then it stores the result. This suggests **O(1)** vs. **O(n)** time
complexity in Sterling's favor.

You won't get this sort of performance for a web application because of their side effect-driven nature, but for number
crunching Sterling may very well be a good idea.

## @TODO

### How does memoization impact memory?

Obviously, those calculated values get stored somewhere, and somewhere means memory is being used. I should perform
another benchmark comparing memory requirements of the Fibonacci algorithm between pure Java and Sterling.

### What if I don't want memoization for a particular function?

There may be some cases where you want to recalculate a value for a known argument. For example, if I query a database
I shouldn't necessarily  expect the same result each time. Sterling should give an easy way of signalling that a
function should not leverage memoization.
