Since [mid January](https://github.com/lmcgrath/sterling/tree/8b58ce4d4b080b353f7870ec0c0c30639fb2fa7b), I’ve been
developing a functional scripting language I call [Sterling](https://github.com/lmcgrath/sterling). In the past few
weeks, Sterling has become nearly usable, but it doesn’t seem to be very fast. So this weekend, I’ve taking the time to
create a simple (read: na&iuml;ve) benchmark.

The benchmark uses a [recursive algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Fibonacci_sequence) to
calculate the Nth member of the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence). I’ve implemented
both Sterling and Java versions of the algorithm and I will be benchmarking each for comparison.

``` haskell Sterling Implementation
fibonacci = n -> if n = 0 then 0
                 else if n = 1 then 1
                 else fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)
```

``` java Java Implementation
static int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```

### Why was the Fibonacci sequence chosen for the benchmark?

The algorithm for calculating the Nth member of the Fibonacci sequence has two key traits:

* It’s recursive
* It has O(2<sup>n</sup>) complexity

Sterling as of right now performs zero optimizations, so I’m assuming this algorithm will bring out Sterling’s
worst performance characteristics (muahahaha).

## The benchmark execution plan

I’m using a very basic benchmark excluding Sterling’s compilation overhead and comparing the results to native Java. I
will execute the Fibonacci algorithm 100 times for 10 iterations, providing an average of the time elapsed for each
iteration.

``` java Benchmark Pseudo-Java&trade;
Expression input = IntegerConstant(20);
Expression sterlingFibonacci = load("sterling/math/fibonacci");

void javaBenchmark() {
    List<Interval> intervals;
    int value = input.getValue();
    for (int i : iterations) {
        long startTime = currentTimeMillis();
        for (int j : executions) {
            fibonacci(value);
        }
        intervals.add(currentTimeMillis() - startTime);
        printIteration(i, intervals.last());
    }
    printAverage(intervals);
}

void sterlingBenchmark() {
    List<Interval> intervals;
    for (int i : iterations) {
        long startTime = currentTimeMillis();
        for (int j : executions) {
            sterlingFibonacci.apply(input).evaluate();
        }
        intervals.add(currentTimeMillis() - startTime);
        printIteration(i, intervals.last());
    }
    printAverage(intervals);
}
```

```

### Immediate conclusions:

Sterling is _**REALLY**_ slow!

Sterling executes directly against an abstract syntax tree representing operations and data. This tree is generally
immutable, so the execution is performed by effectively rewriting the tree to reduce each node into an “atomic”
expression, such as an integer constant or lambda (which can’t be further reduced without an applied argument).

References to functions are inserted into the tree by copying the function’s tree into the reference’s node. The
function is then evaluated with a given argument to reduce the tree to a single node. These copy-and-reduce operations
are very costly and are a likely reason for Sterling’s poor performance.

## @TODO

### Memoization

Copying and reducing a function tree for an argument is expensive. These operations should not need to be performed
more than once for any function and argument pair.

### Bytecode perhaps?

Given the shear amount of recursion and method calls being performed to execute Sterling, does it makes sense to
compile the syntax tree into a bytecode that can be executed in a loop?
