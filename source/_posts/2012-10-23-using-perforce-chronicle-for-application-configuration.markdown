Following Paul Hammant's post [App-config workflow using SCM](http://paulhammant.com/2012/07/10/app-config-workflow-using-scm/) and subsequent [proof of concept](http://paulhammant.com/2012/08/14/app-config-using-git-and-angular/) backed by Git, I will show that an app-config application backed by Perforce is possible using [Perforce Chronicle](http://www.perforce.com/products/chronicle).

## Perforce and permissions for branches

[Perforce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce) is an enterprise-class source control management (SCM) system, remarkably similar to Subversion (Subversion was inspired by Perforce :) Perforce is more bulletproof than Subversion in many ways and it's generally faster. Git does not impose any security constraints or permissions on branches, Perforce gives comprehensive security options allowing you to control access to different branches: for example, development, staging, and production. Subversion, however, can support permissions on branches with some extra configuration (Apache plus mod_dav_svn/mod_dav_authz). For these reasons, Perforce is a better option for storing configuration data than either Git or Subversion.

## Perforce CMS as an application server

[Perforce Chronicle](http://www.perforce.com/products/chronicle) is a content management system (CMS) using Perforce as the back-end store for configuration and content. The app-config application is built on top of Chronicle because Perforce does not offer a web view into the depot the way Subversion can through Apache. Branching and maintaining divergence between environments can be managed through the user interface, and Chronicle provides user authentication and management, so access between different configuration files can be restricted appropriately. The INSTALL.txt file that is distributed with Chronicle helps with an easy install, mine being set up to run locally from `http://localhost`.

There is a key issue in using Chronicle, however. The system is designed for the management of _content_ and not necessarily arbitrary _files_. In order to make the app-config application work, I had to add a custom content type and write a module. Configuration and HTML are both plain-text content, so I created a "Plain Text" content type with the fields _title_ and _content_:

1. Go to "Manage" > "Content Types"
1. Click "Add Content Type"
1. Enter the following information:

```
Id:       plaintext
Label:    Plain Text
Group:    Assets
Elements:

[title]
type = text
options.label = Title
options.required = true
display.tagName = h1
display.filters.0 = HtmlSpecialChars

[content]
type = textarea
options.label = Content
options.required = true
display.tagName = pre
display.filters.0 = HtmlSpecialChars
```

Click "Save".

## The Config App

I've borrowed heavily from Paul's [app-config HTML page](https://github.com/paul-hammant/app-config-app/blob/master/index.html), which uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) to manage the UI and interaction with the server. Where Paul's app-config app used the [jshon](http://kmkeen.com/jshon/) command to encode and decode JSON, Zend Framework has a utility class for encoding, decoding, and pretty-printing JSON, and Chronicle also ships with the [simplediff](https://github.com/paulgb/simplediff/) utility for performing diffs with PHP.

The source JSON configuration is the same, albeit sorted:

{% include_code lang:json app-config/stack_configuration.json %}

The index.html page has been modified from the original to support only the basic _commit_ and _diffs_ functionality:

{% include_code lang:html app-config/index.html %}

Both of these assets were added by performing:

1. Click "Add" from the top navbar
1. Click "Add Content"
1. Select "Assets" > "Plain Text"
1. For "Title", enter "index.html" or "stack_configuration.json"
1. Paste in the appropriate "Content"
1. Click "URL", select "Custom", and enter the same value as "Title" (otherwise, Chronicle will convert underscores to dashes, so be careful!)
1. Click "Save", enter a commit message, then click the next "Save"
1. Both assets should be viewable as mangled Chronicle content entries from `http://localhost/index.html` and `http://localhost/stack_configuration.json`. _You normally will not use these URLs_.

At this point, neither asset is actually usable. Most content is heavily decorated with additional HTML and then displayed within a layout template, but I want both the index.html and stack_configuration.json assets to be viewable as standalone files and provide a REST interface for AngularJS to work against.

## Come back PHP! All is forgiven

Chronicle is largely built using [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) and makes adding extra modules to the system pretty easy. My module needs to be able to display plaintext assets, update their content using an HTTP POST, and provide diffs between the last commit and the current content.

To create the module, the following paths need to be added:

* `INSTALL/application/appconfig`
* `INSTALL/application/appconfig/controllers`
* `INSTALL/application/appconfig/views/scripts/index`

Declare the module with `INSTALL/application/appconfig/module.ini`:

{% include_code lang:ruby app-config/module/module.ini %}

Add a view script for displaying plaintext assets, `INSTALL/application/appconfig/views/scripts/index/index.phtml`:

{% include_code lang:php app-config/module/views/scripts/index/index.phtml %}

Add a view script for displaying diffs, `INSTALL/application/appconfig/views/scripts/index/diffs.phtml`:

{% include_code lang:php app-config/module/views/scripts/index/diffs.phtml %}

And a controller at `INSTALL/application/appconfig/controllers/IndexController.phtml`:

{% include_code lang:php app-config/module/controllers/IndexController.php %}

## AngularJS

After all files are in place, Chronicle needs to be notified that the new module exists by going to "Manage" > "Modules", where the "Appconfig" module will be listed if all goes well :) Both assets will now be viewable from `http://localhost/appconfig/index.html` and `http://localhost/appconfig/stack_configuration.json`. AngularJS' [$resource service](http://code.angularjs.org/0.9.19/docs-0.9.19/#!/api/angular.service.$resource) is used in index.html to fetch stack_configuration.json and post changes back.

From `http://localhost/appconfig/index.html`, the data from stack_configuration.json is loaded into the form:

{% img /images/app-config/start.png %}

Edits to stack_configuration.json can be made using the form, and the diffs viewed by clicking on "View Diffs":

{% img /images/app-config/diffs.png %}

The changes can be saved by entering a commit message and clicking "Commit Changes". After which, clicking "View Diffs" will show no changes:

{% img /images/app-config/diffs-after-commit.png %}

To show that edits have in fact been made to stack_configuration.json, go to `http://localhost/stack_configuration.json`, select "History" and click on "History List":

{% img /images/app-config/history.png %}

Chronicle also provides an interface for viewing diffs between revisions:

{% img /images/app-config/history-diffs.png %}

## @TODO

### Security!

There's one major flaw with the appconfig module: it performs zero access checks. By default, Chronicle can be configured to disallow anonymous access by going to "Manage" > "Permissions" and deselecting all permissions for "anonymous" and "members". Logging out and attempting to access either `http://localhost/appconfig/stack_configuration.json` or `http://localhost/appconfig/index.html` will now give an error page and prompt you to log in. Clicking "New User" will also give an error, as anonymous users don't have the permission to create users.

Access rights on content are checked by the content module, but are also hard-coded in the associated controllers as IF-statements. A better solution will be required for proper access management in the appconfig module.

### Better integration

Chronicle's content module provides JSON integration for most of its actions, but these mostly exist to support the [Dojo Toolkit-enabled](http://dojotoolkit.org/) front-end. Integrating with these actions over JSON requires detailed knowledge of Chronicle's form structures.

Chronicle has some nice interfaces for viewing diffs. If I could call those up from index.html I would be major happy :)

### Automatic creation of plaintext content type

Before the appconfig module is usable, the plaintext content type has to be created. I would like to automate creation of the plaintext content type when the module is first enabled.

### Making applications aware of updates to configuration

When stack_configuration.json is updated, there's no way to notify applications to the change, and no interface provided so they may poll for changes. I'm not entirely sure at this point what an appropriate solution would look like. In order to complete the concept, I'd first have to create a client app dependent on that configuration.

### Better interfaces for manipulating plaintext assets

I had to fiddle with index.html quite a bit. This basically involved editing a local copy of index.html, then pasting the entire contents into the associated form in Chronicle. I have not tried checking out index.html directly from Perforce, and I imagine that any edits would need to be made within Chronicle. Github offers an in-browser raw editor, and something like that would be real handy in Chronicle.

### Handling conflicts

There is no logic in the appconfig module to catch conflicts if there are two users editing the same file. Conflicts are detectible because an exception is thrown if there is a conflict, but I'm not sure what the workflow for resolution is in Chronicle terms, or how to integrate with it. Who wins?

### Working with branches

I did not take the time to see how Chronicle manages branches. I will need to verify that Chronicle and the appconfig module can work with development, staging, and production branches, with maintained divergence.
